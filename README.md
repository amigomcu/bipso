## Documentation  

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/bluetoother/bipso/wiki).

<br />

## Overview  

**bipso** is a dictionary for developers to query the UUIDs and Characteristic definitions defined by BIPSO. With BIPSO, firmware developers can organize Characteristics in an IPSO way to make their BLE devices/products IPSO-compatible.  
  
Please see [BIPSO Specification](https://github.com/bluetoother/bipso/wiki/BIPSO-Specification) to learn more about why BIPSO and what it is doing.
